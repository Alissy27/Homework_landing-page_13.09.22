            About koalas
        </h2>
        <p id="about__koalas">
            The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native
            to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living
            relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern
            regions, inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is easily recognisable by
            its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has
            a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb). Fur colour ranges from silver grey to
            chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their
            counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate subspecies, but this is disputed.

        <h2>
            Etymology
        </h2>
        <p id="etymology">
            The word koala comes from the Dharug gula, meaning no water. Although the vowel 'u' was originally written
            in the English orthography as "oo" (in spellings such as coola or koolah — two syllables), later became "oa"
            and is now pronounced in three syllables, possibly in error.
        </p>
        <h2>Habitat and distribution</h2>
        <p id="habitat__and__distribution">
            Koalas live over a range of open forest and woodland communities but ultimately their habitat is defined by
            the presence of a select group of food trees. Koalas are found in higher densities where food trees are
            growing on more fertile soils and along watercourses. They do, however, remain in areas where their habitat
            has been partially cleared and in urban areas.
            The distribution of koalas covers much of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and a small area in South
            Australia. Over the past 200 years, their distribution does not appear to have reduced, however, individual
            koala populations have declined. Local extinctions have occurred due to clearing and fragmentation of
            eucalypt woodlands and forests for agriculture and human settlement. Fossil records indicate that many years
            ago, the koala inhabited parts of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. There are no fossil records
            of koalas ever living in Tasmania.
            In Queensland, the greatest concentration of koalas is in South East Queensland where they now compete for
            space with a rapidly growing human population.</p>
